Porn*
===============================
Ad-Networks, Facebook and your favorite hacker are tracking you? Who cares. Protect your 
privacy where it really matters. At home. From your girlfriend!
Porn* will do it for you. Automatically. It will check if a requested domain has an 
OpenDNS-tag for pornographic content and if so will load the site in an incognito window 
and delete the url from your history.

To-do:
	- options page -> allow user to specify which tags are checked
	- add panic button that only shows on tagged sites
	- bug fixes
	- check OpenDNS ToS!! -> alternative? 

Known bugs:
	- will trigger if domain is not tagged at all
